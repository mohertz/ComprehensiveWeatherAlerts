# Comprehensive Weather Alerts
This program is designed to work with a database of users and locations and send personalized weather forecast emails to those users.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You should already have sqlite3 and Python3 on your system before starting the program.

You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.org. This will enable you to check the 5-day forecast necessary for the program.

You will also need the SMTP information for the email address you'd like to use to send the alerts.

### UPDATE

The Previous information for this program is no longer valid. A new write-up of the readme is coming!
